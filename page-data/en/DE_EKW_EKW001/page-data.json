Only three specimens are known to have survived.  Following Luther's Theses from 31 October 1517 a theological discussion flared up, culminating in a public disputation that took place in Leipzig from the 27 June until the 15 July 1519. Prior to this disputation Karlstadt commissioned Cranach to produce this woodcut. The print polemically juxtaposes a theological stance based on Augustine and Paul, which shows the way to Christ (top, right to left), and a scholarly one, that leads directly into Hell (bottom, left to right). The message is reinforced by a large amount of text. The sheet marks the beginning of Cranach's Reformation propaganda and achieved its goal: Eck complained to the elector and the clergy in Leipzig tore it up on the pulpit and asked students in the confession box whether they had laughed. An impression of the print was also received by Albrecht Dürer in Nuremberg. \n[Exhib. Cat. Düsseldorf 2017, 195, No. 99]","dimensions":"Sheet: 29.9 x 40.7 cm\n[Exhib. Cat.
