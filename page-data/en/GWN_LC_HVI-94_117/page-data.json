This image depicts a tournament with the tapestry protraying Hercules in combat with the lion and the two saxon shields, hanging from a balcony in the background. Numerous armed knights are represented on horseback, two of them are tilting. In the background spectators stand on the balcony. Cranach and his workshop were also employed to paint banners and to design ceremonial trappings for these events and the tapestry is an example of such manufacture. Cranach probably also drew on existing illustrations and tapestries depicting tournaments for inspiration.","dimensions":"Image: 295 x 419 mm (+- 2 mm)\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"AT_A_DG1929-126","inscription":"","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2019]","role":"Inventor","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"markings":"","locations":[],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":[{"pageNumber":"294","referenceId":"241","title":"Bartsch 1808"},{"pageNumber":"227, 228","referenceId":"160","title":"Exhib.
