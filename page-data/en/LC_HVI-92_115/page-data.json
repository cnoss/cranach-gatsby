In contrast with Cranach's later painted versions of this subject, which represent rather more staged groups, this print's continuous narrative shows aerial perspective scenes from the hunt in a rather didactic manner. The events unfold chronologically starting at the top left, where the hunting dogs are released from their kennels and reach their climax in the middle ground with the captured boar and stag. In the foreground, the nobleman directly above Cranach's signature, who has drawn his sword, might represent Friedrich the Wise. This image is known in two states: in the earlier version the electoral coat of arms in the top left corner still has a black ground in the base, while in the later version this has been inverted. \n1st state: the electoral coat of arms, sable in base\n2nd state: state: the electoral coat of arms, sable in chief\nlater impressions: the upper borderline lost from the block","dimensions":"Image: 379 x 513 mm (using 2 blocks) (+- 2 mm)\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","inscription":"","involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":[{"pageNumber":"292","referenceId":"241","title":"Bartsch 1808"},{"pageNumber":"282","referenceId":"346","title":"Dodgson 1911"},{"pageNumber":"241, 242","referenceId":"160","title":"Exhib.
