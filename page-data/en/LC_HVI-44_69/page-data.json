Upon a shield supported by four flying angels is displayed a heart, surmounted by flames confined within a crown. A crucifix is framed within the heart; a scroll with or without text (depending on the state of the impression) passes in front of the stem of the cross; descending flames form a pattern upon the right side of the heart. Beneath the shield is a landscape, containing a view of a castle surrounded by a deer park. In the foreground are two pairs of kneeling saints: the Virgin and St John at the centre, with St Sebastian and St Roche behind them. Their presence indicates that the print was associated with protection from the plague.\nThe date 1505 is placed, within the monogram, beneath St John, and the two coats of arms of Saxony occupy the lower corners, the electoral on the left, the ducal on the right. These shields denoting Cranach's official appointment make their first appearance here. The electoral shield with the two crossed swords has the earlier form, in which the lower half of the field is sable, the upper argent, while the ducal shield is shown with three leaves rather than the later five. This arrangement was reversed in the year 1507 or 1508, and many of Cranach's woodcuts were then altered. However, in this case the original shield remains unaltered even in late impressions and subsequent states. \nIn one state the scroll was empty and in another bears the inscription 'VIRGO MATER MARIA'. Late impressions of the state without text have the names, S. SEBASTIANVS . S.MARIA . S. IOHANNES . S. ROCHVS., printed on the lower margin.","dimensions":"Image: 380 x 284 mm (+- 2 mm)\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","inscription":"The cross is titled 'IN R'I in the
