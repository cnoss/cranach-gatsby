Although the subject is clearly St George, the 'A' ('Altosterreich'?) on the caparison of the horse appears in this way on other Cranach prints and possibly refers to the Emperor Maximilian himself, who was known to be involved in raising the status of the knightly Order of St George during this period. There is a castle in the right background and the two Saxon shields are in the boughs at upper left.\nThis woodcut represents an important and well-documented stage in the history of colour printing.\n1st state: the electoral coat of arms, sable in base; the paper has been prepared with an indigo wash. The manner in which the wash has been applied is suggestive of an atmospheric landscape, and serves as a clue to the original purpose of these prints, which was to emulate the highly finished drawings on a coloured ground fashionable at that date. The line block which registered the heightened areas was printed first, inked with some kind of glue to which gold leaf was then applied and the outline block in black was printed second.\nThe outline block was a self-contained composition which could be printed as a monochrome print, and further impressions of the 'St George' were printed in this way at a later date.\n2nd state: the electoral coat of arms, sable in chief","dimensions":"block marks: 23.3 x 15.9 cm\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"AT_A_DG1929-100","inscription":"on the caparison of the horse, in the block: 'A'","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2019]","role":"Inventor","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"markings":"","locations":[],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":[{"pageNumber":"284","referenceId":"241","title":"Bartsch 1808"},{"pageNumber":"286, 287","referenceId":"346","title":"Dodgson 1911"},{"pageNumber":"63, 64","referenceId":"160","title":"Exhib.

It had clearly so impressed Peutinger that he had commissioned a similar experiment in colour printing himself from Hans Burgkmair. Impressions of the resultant prints, the 'St George and Maximilian on Horseback' printed in gold and silver on parchment, were enclosed with his letter to Friedrich [Bartrum, Exhib. Cat. London 1995, nos. 132, 134]. Peutinger asked Friedrich to give his opinion on 'whether they are well printed or not', and then wrote on the following day to Duke Georg of Saxony asking for his opinion on the new technique and indicating his close involvement with the project: 'I have, together with my artists, discovered a method of printing in gold and silver on parchment and paper'. A reply of 17 October from Duke Georg to Peutinger records much admiration of the technique (the letters are quoted in Falk's book on Burgkmair, p. 115).\n[Bartrum, Exhib. Cat.
