The book was published as authorless, but contains quotations from the Bible and the canon law chosen by Philipp Melanchthon and Johann Schwertfeger. Cranach polemically employed opposites by juxtaposing scenes from Christ's Passion with events from the Pope's life to show how far removed it was from Christ's message. Here the text is located beneath the image. \n[This image shows 'The Emperor kissing the Pope's toe' and is juxtaposed with an image of 'Christ washing the Apostles' Feet'.]\n[Exhib. Cat.
