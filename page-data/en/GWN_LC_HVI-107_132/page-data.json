After leaving Worms on the 26 April, 1521, Luther was arrested near Altenburg on the 4th of May by two masked men (friends) and taken to the Wartburg where he remained in retreat dressed as a knight and letting his beard grow until the 3rd March 1522. During this time he paid a hasty visit to Wittenberg where he remained in complete seclusion seeing only Cranach who recognized him straight away.  Cranach portrayed him with a beard, looking out to the left and this image was to mark his return to the public stage in 1522. It was widely disseminated with at least four different textual variants and continued to be printed until late into the 16th century. The inscription celebrates Luther's return employing the island of Patmos (where St John wrote the Apocalypse) as a metaphor for his time at the Wartburg.","dimensions":"block marks: 28.5 x 20.6 cm (+- 2 mm)\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"AT_A_DG1929-242","inscription":"","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"","role":"Inventor","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"markings":"","locations":[],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":[{"pageNumber":"18","referenceId":"30162","title":""},{"pageNumber":"316","referenceId":"346","title":"Dodgson 1911"},{"pageNumber":"107","referenceId":"736","title":"Hollstein 1959"},{"pageNumber":"405","referenceId":"1939","title":"Jahn, Bernhard 1972"},{"pageNumber":"49-51","referenceId":"1445","title":"Warnke 1984"}],"relatedWorks":"","references":[{"inventoryNumber":"AT_A_DG1929-242","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132c","text":"Abzug A","ref":{"langCode":"en","slug":"AT_A_DG1929-242","objectName":"Holzschnitt","inventoryNumber":"AT_A_DG1929-242","objectId":928054,"isVirtual":false,"sortingNumber":"","titles":[{"remarks":"","title":"Luther as Junker Jörg","type":"Titel"}],"bibliography":"","catalogWorkReferences":[{"description":"Hollstein","referenceNumber":"VI.107.132 (c)"}],"classification":{"classification":"Druckgrafik","condition":"2nd edition"},"dating":{"begin":1517,"dated":"1522","end":1527,"historicEventInformations":[],"remarks":"[dated, printed later][Albertina, revised 2019]"},"description":"- Hollstein 132c","dimensions":"sheet: 35.1 x 21.2 cm\n[Albertina, Wien, revised 2018]","exhibitionHistory":"","inscription":"IMAGO MARTINI LVTHERI EO HABIT V EX=/ PRESSA, QVO REVERSVS EST E[X] PATHMO VVITTE=/BERGAM ANNO DOMINI 1522.\n\nBelow:\nTwo couplets in single column:\nQueasitus toties, toties tibi Roma petitus,/ En ego per Christum uiuo Lutherus adhuc.\nVna mihi spes est, quo non fraudabor, Iesus,/ Hunc mihi dum teneam, perfida Roma uale.\n\nIn three columns:\nANNVS CONFESSIONIS VVOR=/MACIAE 1521./ CaesarIs ante peDes, proCeres stetit ante potentes/ ACCoLa qVà Rheni VangIo LhtVs aDIt.\nANNVS PATHMI/ 1521./ A Rheno properans CapItVr, benè ConsCIa PathMI/ TeCta, Papae fVgiens retIna strVCta, petIt. \nANNVS REDITVS EX/ PATHMO 1522./ CarLstaDII ob fVrias aD SaXonateCtarrCVrrIt,/ FaVCibVs ex saeVis rVrsVs oVesqVe rapIt.","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Albertina, Wien, revised 2018]","role":"Inventor","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"Vienna","type":"Location Cranach Object"}],"medium":"Print on paper\n[cda 2018]","owner":"Albertina, Wien","provenance":"- Albertina, early aquisition\n[Albertina, revised 2019]","publications":[{"pageNumber":"","referenceId":"807","title":"Exhib.
