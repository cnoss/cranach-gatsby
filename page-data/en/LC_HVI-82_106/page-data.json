A chasm had suddenly appeared, which according to soothsayers could only be filled by throwing into it Rome's greatest treasure. Marcus Curtius interpreted this to mean the city's valiant youth and accordingly sacrificed himself, by leaping on horseback into the chasm which closed over his head (Livy 7:6). The armed and mounted soldier plunges into the chasm in the foreground; behind is a platform with a pavillion and seven figures; landscape background, the two Saxon shields are placed underneath the buildings's architrave.\nThe image provides an unusually specific illustration of the way in which the interests of the humanists at the court of Friedrich the Wise were broadcast through prints. Small objects of Italian Renaissance metalware were much sought after by the intellectual élite, such as Friedrich's chancellor, Degenhart Pfeffinger (1471-1519), and the main part of this composition was inspired by a bronze of this type (possibly one attributed to Giovanni delle Opere or delle Corniole). The central figures and the Bramantesque temple are copied in reverse after a small bronze Italian plaquette, designed for insertion into a sword pommel.","dimensions":"Image: 335 × 235 mm (+- 2 mm)\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","inscription":"","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2019]","role":"Inventor","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":{"primary":[],"secondary":[{"id":"241","shortTitle":"Bartsch 1808","pageNumber":"291","catalogNumber":"","figureNumber":"","roles":{"AUTHOR":["Adam Bartsch"]},"title":"<i>Le peintre graveur.

The significance of this head is not clear, although it has been suggested that it is a portrait bust (John Pope-Hennessy, 'A Catalogue of Renaissance Bronzes from the Samuel H. Kress Collection', London, 1965, pp.35-6, no. 108, fig. 129). Cranach has altered it into a complete figure of a laureated Roman emperor, watching the scene from a hillock. He has also expanded the composition in a lateral direction in order to fit the landscape, which gives an entirely Germanic setting to the subject, within and around the temple. Cranach has also given the temple more elongated proportions and added classicising details, including the profile portraits within roundels inserted into the spandrels. The intricate patterning of the soldiers' feet has, however, been retained from the bronze original, as has a figure style which is quite alien to Cranach's own.\n[Bartrum, Exhib. Cat.
