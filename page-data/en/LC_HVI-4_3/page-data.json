Two editions are known (a third one was probably planned, but never completed). The first edition was published in 1509 with 108 woodcuts by Lucas Cranach the Elder, showing reliquaries and treasures in the church of All Saints. The second edition contains a set of 119 woodcuts. This engraving served as the title-page to the second edition of the Wittenberg Heiligthumsbuch with an impression of Cranach's woodcut of the church of All Saints printed on the verso (Hollstein, 96). The title of the book 'Dye zaigung des hochlobwirdi= // gen hailigthumbs der Stifft // kirchen aller hailigen zu // wittenburg' was printed on the sheet above the image in letterpress. The engraving was also issued in a separate edition in which the versos are blank. \nThe image shows Elector Friedrich the Wise who ruled Saxony jointly with his brother, Duke Johann the Constant (1468-1532). They are set in a niche behind a ballustrade. Friedrich holds rosary beads in his hands and his gaze is directed piously upwards. Both are dressed in stately attire and the electoral coats of arms decorate the upper corners. Cranach has placed his insignia in a prominent position on a plaque at the centre of the ballustrade. \nTogether the brothers were responsible for enlarging the collection of treasures and relics for the church of All Saints begun by their ancestors. Friedrich later became an active supporter of Martin Luther and the Reformation and was excommunicated by the Pope in 1524.","dimensions":"Image: 132 x 118 mm (+- 5 mm)\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","inscription":"","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[http://sammlungenonline.albertina.at/?query=Inventarnummer=[DG1929/76]&showtype=record]","role":"Inventor","suffix":""},{"alternativeName":"Symphorian Reinhart","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Symphorian Reinhart","nameType":"Primärer Name","prefix":"","remarks":"","role":"printer","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]},{"constituentId":"201326","details":[{"name":"Symphorian Reinhart","nameType":"Primärer Name"}]}],"markings":"","locations":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":{"primary":[],"secondary":[{"id":"30162","shortTitle":"","pageNumber":"","catalogNumber":"","figureNumber":"","roles":{"AUTHOR":["Johann David Passavant"]},"title":"<i>Le peintre-graveur.
