Cranach and his assistant, who signed the last illustration with the monogram 'HB' (Hans Brosamer?), furnished the Apocalypse of St John with woodcuts [21], drawing heavily on Dürer`s series of the Apocalypse from 1498 [...]. This sheet shows ¿The Measuring of the Temple of God¿ (Rev. 11, 1-2). The animal from the abyss described in the text is depicted here wearing the papal tiara. However, after complaints by Georg, Duke of Saxony, a believer in the Old Faith this image was removed from the edition published two months later known as the 'Dezembertestament'. \n[Exhib. Cat.
