It had clearly so impressed Peutinger that he had commissioned a similar experiment in colour printing himself from Hans Burgkmair. Impressions of the resultant prints, the 'St George and Maximilian on Horseback' printed in gold and silver on parchment, were enclosed with his letter to Friedrich [Bartrum, Exhib. Cat. London 1995, nos. 132, 134]. Peutinger asked Friedrich to give his opinion on 'whether they are well printed or not', and then wrote on the following day to Duke Georg of Saxony asking for his opinion on the new technique and indicating his close involvement with the project: 'I have, together with my artists, discovered a method of printing in gold and silver on parchment and paper'. A reply of 17 October from Duke Georg to Peutinger records much admiration of the technique (the letters are quoted in Falk's book on Burgkmair, p. 115).\n[Bartrum, Exhib. Cat.
