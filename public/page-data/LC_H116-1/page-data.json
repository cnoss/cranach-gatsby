Cat. Basel 1974, 108]. Given Cranach's position of painter to the Saxon court, his workshop would probably have been responsible for the various painted caparisons and wall decorations associated with tournaments. In around 1535 at least two artists of his school produced a tournament book decorated with highly finished drawings heightened with gold and silver which show the Elector Johann Friedrich jousting with a different combatant on each page (Veste Coburg; see [Exhib. Cat. Detroit 1981,16]; this is one of a number of elaborately decorated tournament books associated with the German aristocracy that have survived. They include 'Freydal', a book of drawings commissioned c.1512 by the Emperor, which was to have been printed but the woodcuts were never completed (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum; see [Exhib. Cat.
