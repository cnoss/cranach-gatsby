The significance of this head is not clear, although it has been suggested that it is a portrait bust (John Pope-Hennessy, 'A Catalogue of Renaissance Bronzes from the Samuel H. Kress Collection', London, 1965, pp.35-6, no. 108, fig. 129). Cranach has altered it into a complete figure of a laureated Roman emperor, watching the scene from a hillock. He has also expanded the composition in a lateral direction in order to fit the landscape, which gives an entirely Germanic setting to the subject, within and around the temple. Cranach has also given the temple more elongated proportions and added classicising details, including the profile portraits within roundels inserted into the spandrels. The intricate patterning of the soldiers' feet has, however, been retained from the bronze original, as has a figure style which is quite alien to Cranach's own.\n[Bartrum, Exhib. Cat.
