After leaving Worms on the 26 April, 1521, Luther was arrested near Altenburg on the 4th of May by two masked men (friends) and taken to the Wartburg where he remained in retreat dressed as a knight and letting his beard grow until the 3rd March 1522. During this time he paid a hasty visit to Wittenberg where he remained in complete seclusion seeing only Cranach who recognized him straight away.  Cranach portrayed him with a beard, looking out to the left and this image was to mark his return to the public stage in 1522. It was widely disseminated with at least four different textual variants and continued to be printed until late into the 16th century. The inscription celebrates Luther's return employing the island of Patmos (where St John wrote the Apocalypse) as a metaphor for his time at the Wartburg.","dimensions":"Block marks: 28.3 x 20.4 cm\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","inscription":"","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"","role":"Inventor","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"keywords":[{"path":"Attributes > Objekte > Cranach-Archiv > Technik > 010501","term":"010501","type":"Schlagwort"},{"path":"Attributes > Objekte > Cranach-Archiv > Inhalt > Bildnisse > Männliche Bildnisse > Bekannte Personen > 010402010128","term":"010402010128","type":"Schlagwort"},{"path":"Attributes > Objekte > Cranach-Archiv > Funktion > 010107","term":"010107","type":"Schlagwort"}],"markings":"","locations":[],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":[{"pageNumber":"316","referenceId":"346","title":"Dodgson 1911"},{"pageNumber":"107","referenceId":"736","title":"Hollstein 1959"},{"pageNumber":"405","referenceId":"1939","title":"Jahn, Bernhard 1972"},{"pageNumber":"49-51","referenceId":"1445","title":"Warnke 1984"},{"pageNumber":"18","referenceId":"30162","title":""}],"relatedWorks":"","references":[{"inventoryNumber":"AT_A_DG1929-242","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132c","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"BE_KBR_S-II20715","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_GNMN_Mp14637a","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132c","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_HAUMB_AB3-74","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_HAUMB_V3-1696","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132d","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_KSVC_H64","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132c","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_KSW_DK-181-83","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132c","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_SGSM_1912-997D","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132d","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_SKD_A 6645","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_SMBKSK_66-1898","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132c","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_SSB_I-L-44","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_WSE_G1359","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132b","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"UK_BM_1895-0122-279","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132b","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"UK_BM_O-3-190","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132c","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"US_MMANY_27-54-27","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132b","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"US_MMANY_41-1-163","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"US_NGA_1943-3-2875","remark":"Hollstein VI.107.132b","text":"Abzug A"}],"repository":"","signature":"None","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"28.30","width":"0.00"},"additionalTextInformation":[{"text":"Two editions of the woodcut.
