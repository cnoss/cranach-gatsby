It illustrates a tournament with lances. Numerous mounted knights are fighting on the ground accompanied by musicians in the left background. The shabraque of the knight in the foreground at the right is decorated with the initial 'G'. Spectators stand on a gallery in the right background, bear the two Saxon shields. Cranach and his workshop were also employed to paint banners and to design ceremonial trappings for these events. Cranach probably also drew on existing illustrations and tapestries depicting tournaments for inspiration.","dimensions":"block marks: 29.2 x 41.6 cm\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","inscription":"- on the shabraque of the knight in the foreground at the right:\na repeat pattern incorporating the initial 'G'.","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2019]","role":"Inventor","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"keywords":[{"path":"Attributes > Objekte > Cranach-Archiv > Form > 010205","term":"010205","type":"Schlagwort"},{"path":"Attributes > Objekte > Cranach-Archiv > Technik > 010501","term":"010501","type":"Schlagwort"},{"path":"Attributes > Objekte > Cranach-Archiv > Inhalt > Genre > 01040402","term":"01040402","type":"Schlagwort"}],"markings":"","locations":[],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":[{"pageNumber":"294","referenceId":"241","title":"Bartsch 1808"},{"pageNumber":"293","referenceId":"346","title":"Dodgson 1911"},{"pageNumber":"228","referenceId":"160","title":"Exhib.
