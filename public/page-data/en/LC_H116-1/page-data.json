It is his first representation of a tournament and shows the events from an aerial perspective as they unfold on a large public square. It is one of a small group of woodcuts of jousting tournaments designed by Cranach between 1506 and 1509, which are based on events that took place in the market-place in Wittenberg [Hollstein, VI.93.117-119]. The complex design of this print contains numerous combatants on horseback jousting with lances in a square surrounded by buildings; the knight in the lower right corner with the letter 'A' ('Altösterreich'?) on his caparison is seen in other prints and possibly represents the Emperor Maximilian. The coats of arms of Saxony are represented on the tapestry hanging over the balcony balustrade.\nPossibly originally designed to be hand-coloured (se version of 1st state in Dresden).\n1st state: the electoral coat of arms, sable in base\n2nd state: the electoral coat of arms, sable in chief","dimensions":"block marks: 25.6 x 37.2 cm\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","inscription":"on the knight in the lower right corner: 'A'","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[cda 2019]","role":"Inventor","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"keywords":[{"path":"","term":"","type":""}],"markings":"","locations":[],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":[{"pageNumber":"293","referenceId":"241","title":"Bartsch 1808"},{"pageNumber":"284","referenceId":"346","title":"Dodgson 1911"},{"pageNumber":"93","referenceId":"736","title":"Hollstein 1959"}],"relatedWorks":"","references":[{"inventoryNumber":"AT_A_DG1929-97","remark":"","text":"Abzug A"},{"inventoryNumber":"DE_SKD_A6623","remark":"","text":"Abzug A"}],"repository":"","signature":"Artist's insignia in the block, upper right above the door: monogram 'LC' and dated '1506'","structuredDimension":{"element":"Maßstab CDA","height":"25.60","width":"0.00"},"additionalTextInformation":[{"text":"An impression of the first state of this print in the Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden, is partly hand-coloured, which greatly clarifies the composition [Exhib. Cat. Basel 1974, 108]. Given Cranach's position of painter to the Saxon court, his workshop would probably have been responsible for the various painted caparisons and wall decorations associated with tournaments. In around 1535 at least two artists of his school produced a tournament book decorated with highly finished drawings heightened with gold and silver which show the Elector Johann Friedrich jousting with a different combatant on each page (Veste Coburg; see [Exhib. Cat. Detroit 1981,16]; this is one of a number of elaborately decorated tournament books associated with the German aristocracy that have survived. They include 'Freydal', a book of drawings commissioned c.1512 by the Emperor, which was to have been printed but the woodcuts were never completed (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum; see [Exhib. Cat. Vienna 1959, no. 69]).\n[Bartrum, Exhib. Cat. London 1995, 169]","type":"Description/ Interpretation/ Comments","year":null}]}}}
