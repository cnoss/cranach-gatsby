The court painter was inspired by Dürer's portrait of Albrecht, Cardinal of Brandenburg to create this etching. Luther is shown in three quarter profile, facing left. The habit and tonsure identify him as an Augustinian monk, and his facial expression reveals his determination and strong willpower. \n[...] An altered version of the earlier print [CDA:G_AT_A_DG1929-78] shows Luther as a half-length figure with hands. He grasps a closed book in his right hand and holds his left hand in front of his body. The reformer is shown in a niche and his face appears milder and more soulful. It was the first official portrait of Luther and frequently copied by artists in subsequent years.\n[Exhib. Cat.
