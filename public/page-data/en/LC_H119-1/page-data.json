This image depicts a tournament with swords. Numerous mounted knights are fighting on the ground. Like in the tourament with lances here the shabraque of the knight in the foreground at the right is decorated with the initial 'G'. There are musicians on horseback and spectators on a balcony in background. The the two Saxon shields are displayed either side of the balcony. Cranach and his workshop were also employed to paint banners and to design ceremonial trappings for these events. Cranach probably also drew on existing illustrations and tapestries depicting tournaments for inspiration.","dimensions":"block marks: 29.6 x 41.8 cm\n[cda 2019]","exhibitionHistory":"","inscription":"- on the shabraque of the knight in the foreground at the right: a repeat patteern with the initial 'G'.","involvedPersons":[{"alternativeName":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","date":"","id":"","isUnknown":false,"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform","prefix":"","remarks":"[Staatliche Kunstsammlung, Dresden, revised 2018]","role":"Inventor","suffix":""}],"involvedPersonsNames":[{"constituentId":"32400","details":[{"name":"Lucas Cranach der Ältere","nameType":"Primärer Name"},{"name":"Lucas Cranach the Elder","nameType":"Andere Suchform"},{"name":"Lucas Sunders","nameType":"Falsche Namensform"}]}],"keywords":[{"path":"Attributes > Objekte > Cranach-Archiv > Inhalt > Genre > 01040402","term":"01040402","type":"Schlagwort"},{"path":"Attributes > Objekte > Cranach-Archiv > Form > 010205","term":"010205","type":"Schlagwort"},{"path":"Attributes > Objekte > Cranach-Archiv > Technik > 010501","term":"010501","type":"Schlagwort"}],"markings":"","locations":[],"medium":"","owner":"","provenance":"","publications":[{"pageNumber":"294","referenceId":"241","title":"Bartsch 1808"},{"pageNumber":"293","referenceId":"346","title":"Dodgson 1911"},{"pageNumber":"228, 229","referenceId":"160","title":"Exhib.
