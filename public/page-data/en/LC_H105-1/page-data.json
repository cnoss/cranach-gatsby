Here Venus and her companion Cupid are shown still standing on clouds and appear to have just descended from Mount Olympus into a landscape north of the Alps. She holds her veil away from her body, emphasizing her nakedness. Cranach transports the goddess to the dominion of his rulers with the landscape and the electoral shields shown together with the artist's insignia and dated '1506' seen here hanging from a branch at the right edge of the image. In fact, it cannot have been produced before 1508 when Cranach was presented with a coat-of arms by Friedrich the Wise. Cranach developed this image as a chiaroscuro woodcut and was antedated seemingly in order to claim priority over his contemporaries for inventing the technique.\n\n1st state: \na. before the change of the left shoulder.
